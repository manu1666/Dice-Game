# React Dice Game

This project is a simple dice game built using React and Vite. In this game, players can guess a number between 1 and 6. If the guessed number matches the number rolled on the dice when clicked, the player earns a score equal to the number guessed. If the guess is incorrect, the player's score is deducted by 2 points.

## How to Play

1. **Guess a Number:** Choose a number between 1 and 6.

2. **Roll the Dice:** Click on the dice to roll it.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - If the number on the dice matches your guess, you earn points equal to the guessed number.
   - If the number on the dice does not match your guess, 2 points are deducted from your score.

4. **Repeat:** Continue playing by guessing a new number and clicking on the dice to roll it.
